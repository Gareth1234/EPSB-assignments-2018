Words and Definitions:

Ethernet Encapsulation:

	LLC sublayers: Handles the communication between the upper layers and the lower layers. Takes the network protocol data and adds control information to help deliver the packet to the destination node.

	MAC sublayer: Implemented by hardware, typically in the computer NIC. the specifics are listed in the IEEE 802.3 standards.

MAC Sublayer:

	Data Encapsulation: The process includes grame assembly before transmission, and the frame disassembly upon reception of a frame.

		Frame delimiting: The framing process provides important delimiters that are used to identify a group of bits that make up a frame.

		Addressing: The encapsulation process contains the Layer 3 PDU and also provides for data link layer addressing.

		Error detection: Each frame contains a trailer used to detect any errors in transmission.

	Media Access Control: Responsible for the placement of frames on the media and the removal of frames from the media.

Ethernet Frame Feilds:

	Preamble: Used for synchroniztation between the sending and receiving device. The first 8 bytes of the frame are used to get the attention of the receiving nodes.

	Destination MAC Address: Used by layer 2 to assist devices in determining if a frame is addressed to them.

	Source MAC Address: Identifies the frame's original NIC or interface. Must be a unicast address.

	EtherType: identifies the upper layer protocol encapsulated in the Ethernet frame.

	Data: Contains the encapsulated data from a higher layer.

	Frame Check Sequence (FCS): Used to detect errors in a frame. 

MAC Address and Hexadecimal:

	Representing Hexadecimal Values: Used to represent Ethernet MAC addresses and IP version 6 addresses.

	Hexadecimal Conversations: Easier to convert the decimal or hexadecimal value to binary, and then convert the binary value to either decimal or hexadecimal as appropriate.
